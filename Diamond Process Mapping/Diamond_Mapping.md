# Task 1: Diamond Manufacturing Process Mapping


## Objective  
To understand the complete diamond manufacturing process and document it in a systematic, visual format that can be used for analysis, reporting, and dashboard development.

## Description  
- Conducted meetings with floor supervisors and operations managers to understand each stage of the production lifecycle.
- Mapped the entire diamond flow from raw material (rough diamond) to final polished output.
- Identified key checkpoints in the process (planning, marking, cutting, polishing, QC, grading, etc.).
- Created a visual flowchart representing the process stages and material movement.
- This flowchart became the foundation for later reporting and dashboard tasks.

## Tools & Skills Used  
- FIGMA (for flowchart creation)  
- Excel (for draft documentation)  
- Communication & process documentation

## Output  
## Diamond Manufacturing Stages (High-Level Overview)

1. **Planning** – Evaluating the rough diamond and planning how to cut it.
2. **Marking** – Physically or digitally marking cutting lines.
3. **Cutting** – Dividing the diamond into planned pieces using lasers or saws.
4. **Polishing** – Giving the diamonds their final shine and shape.
5. **Grading** – Assessing quality, color, clarity, and cut.
6. **Packaging & Dispatch** – Final QA and sending to inventory or shipment.


## Note
Due to confidentiality, the original company flowchart is not shared here. A simplified version or verbal description has been included for demonstration purposes.

 
> 📝 The flowchart helped bridge the communication gap between the operations and data teams, and served as a reference for building accurate production metrics.
