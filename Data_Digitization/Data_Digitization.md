# Task 2: Data Digitization and Structuring for Tracking

## Objective  
To digitize and clean operational Excel files used in the diamond production process, so that key data points could be structured, validated, and tracked effectively for reporting and dashboard creation.

## Description  
- Collected production and inventory-related Excel sheets from growing departments.
- Identified inconsistent formats, missing values, and unstructured entries across files.
- Created and implemented a **Unique Diamond ID** field to track each diamond seed throughout the entire manufacturing process.
- Introduced **Run No.-based tracking** to monitor machine-level production, including operational and downtime patterns.
- Standardized column names and formats, and merged similar sheets into unified, trackable data files.
- Converted raw Excel files into structured datasets ready for further analysis and integration into SQL/Python pipelines.
- Enabled real-time tracking of key metrics such as item status, daily output, and stage-wise movement across departments.

## Tools & Skills Used  
- Excel (data cleaning, standardization)  
- Python (`pandas`, `openpyxl`)  
- Communication with department heads for data clarification

## Output  
Cleaned and structured Excel datasets with traceable Unique Diamond IDs and Run Nos., ready for use in automated reporting workflows and dashboards.

## Impact  
- Enabled full traceability of each diamond's journey from seed to final product  
- Reduced manual reporting errors  
- Improved visibility and reliability of production data for informed decision-making
