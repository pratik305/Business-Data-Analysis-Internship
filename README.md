### üè¢ About the Company

Nuvo Avon Diamond and Jewellery LLP is engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of diamonds and jewellery. The company operates its own manufacturing units located in Dahisar and Kandivali, with its head office based in BKC, Mumbai.

It is a part of the Poddar Diamond Group, which owns multiple jewellery brands catering to both domestic and international markets.

## About This Internship

This internship focused on streamlining the diamond production process and making it more systematic.  
My primary responsibility was to design and develop dashboards that provided clear visibility into the production pipeline for company stakeholders.

This was also the first time the company hired a Business Data Analyst (BDA) team, which meant we had to build everything from scratch ‚Äî including processes, reporting structure, and data pipelines.

The goal was to help decision-makers track progress, identify bottlenecks, and improve operational efficiency through data-driven insights.
